# python-api-challenege
----------------------------
For this Repository I used Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities of varying distance from the equator.

I was able to create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude.
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude. 
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude.
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude.
* The second requirement is to compute the linear regression for each relationship.
* Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude.
* Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude.
* Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude.
* Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude.
* Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude.
* Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude.
* Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude.
* Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude.
